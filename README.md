## Diet - What do Jellyfish eat?
Jellyfish eat many different types of things, such as...
* small plants (phytoplankton)
* copepods (crustacean zooplankton)
* fish eggs and other small fish called larvae
* planktonic eggs and young stages (also called larvae) of many different kinds of marine animals
* even other jellyfish! 

When jellyfish form blooms they eat almost everything in the water and this can cause problems for fisheries because there is no food left for the fish to eat!
