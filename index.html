        <p><b>What do Jellyfish eat?</b></p>
        <p>Jellyfish eat many different types of things, such as...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>small plants (phytoplankton)</li>
          <li>copepods (crustacean zooplankton)</li>
          <li>fish eggs and other small fish called larvae</li>
          <li>planktonic eggs and young stages (also called larvae) of many different kinds of marine animals</li>
          <li>even other jellyfish!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When jellyfish form blooms they eat almost everything in the water and this can cause problems for fisheries because there is no food left for the fish to eat!</p>

        The jellyfish lifecycle isnâ€™t linear, and reproduction can be both asexual and sexual. At an early, post-larval stage, the polyp stage, it can asexually reproduce by cloning itself. This produces a larval stage which can itself advance to the polyp stage and continue this part of the cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
Sexual reproduction happens in the mature, medusa, stage of a jellyfishes lifecycle. Both male and female jellyfish release eggs and sperm into the area, depending on their diet and in some species the time of day. The released genetic material meets in the water and forms larval planula, which anchor themselves to the bottom of a structure until they mature into a polyp.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is not a lot of research around how many eggs are released and fertilized during the sexual cycle, or how many clones can be generated during the asexual process. In some species, it could be up to the thousands.
